Supported services are `twitter`, `github`, `npm`, and `facebook`.  All of them are case sensetive and the space between `:` and `@` is optional.\r\n\r\n  In addition to this there is `local: @user` which becomes a link to `/user/:user:` (where `:user:` is replaced with the username of the person being mentioned).  This is also aliased as the default if you just type `@user`",
